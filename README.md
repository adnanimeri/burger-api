# burger-api
This is a simple burger API.

It will contains information about different type of burgers, including their ingradinets, restaurans where they are served and so on. 


For mooking this API, we need to creat a json based database, e.g., db.json
Then, we need to install a package which enables us to run our database online. That package is json-server, and we can install it:
npm install -g json-server
